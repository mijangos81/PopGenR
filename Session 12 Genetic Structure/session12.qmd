# Session 12 Structure and Faststructure

## Setup

As always we need to have dartRverse installed and loaded. In addition you need to have dartR.popgen installend.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dartRverse)
```

To run STRUCTURE from within R, we need to install the non-GUI executable (the version without frontend) for your operating system \[e.g windows, mac or linux\]. You can download STRUCTURE for your OS from <http://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure_software/release_versions/v2.3.4/html/structure.html>.

To let R know where the executable is, you need to set the path to the executable. For example, under windows, if you have the executable in `d:/programms/structure/structure.exe`, you can use the command below:

### Running STRUCTURE

The small example below is just to test if the programm is set up correctly, hence the binary for your system is in the right place and the path is set correctly.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#quick test to run on windows
bc <- bandicoot.gl[,1:10]
sr <- gl.run.structure(bc, k.range = 2:6, num.k.rep = 5, exec = 'd:/programms/structure/structure.exe' )

```

for Linux/Mac the command looks like this:

```{r,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#quick test to run on linux/mac
bc <- bandicoot.gl[,1:10]
sr <- gl.run.structure(bc, k.range = 2:6, num.k.rep = 5, exec = '../binaries/linux/structure' )

```

### A more serious example: simulated possums

For this example we will run STRUCTURE on a simulated dataset of possums. The dataset is a genlight object and contains 10 populations of 30 individuals each and 1000 loci and is part of the dartRverse package.

To simplify this further we limit our exercise to the first 150 individuals only (which entails now 5 populations a 30 individuals). To get an overview on the population we use the function: `gl.map.interactive` which plots the individuals on a map. Please not the genlight object needs to have valid lat long coordinates for each individual to be able to do so.

```{r}
possums <- possums.gl[1:150,]  #only the first 150 individuals
table(pop(possums)) #check the individuals and the populations

gl.map.interactive(possums)


```

As mentioned this is a simulated data set and we know the true population structure. Populations B and C are very close to each other so those are basically one population and E is at least somewhat in the vicinity. To confirm that our simulation was successful, we quickly can run a pcoa to confirm the population structure.

```{r}

pcoa <- gl.pcoa(possums, plot.out = FALSE, verbose = 0)
gl.pcoa.plot(pcoa, possums, verbose = 0)

```

And yes it looks like expected.

Now, lets see what kind of information we can get from a structure run.

Different to the above we run structure with at least some repetitions for each K (num.k.rep=10) and also over a suitable range. Unfortunately, this takes a while and we will not run it here. Instead we will load the results from a previous run that is saved in the data folder of this repository. \[In case you want to re-run structure simply rename or delete the file in your folder, but be aware that this will take a while.\].

```{r cached run}
if (file.exists("./data/sr.rds")) {
sr<- readRDS("./data/sr.rds")
} else {
possums <- possums.gl[1:150,]
sr <- gl.run.structure(possums, k.range = 2:7, num.k.rep = 10, exec =
                       '../binaries/linux/structure',plot.out = FALSE, 
                       burnin=50000, numreps=100000, noadmix=FALSE)
saveRDS(sr, "./data/sr.rds")
}
```

Hey this was quick! We have the results of the structure run. Let's see what we can do with it.

To run structure we use an dartR implementation of functions which is based on the functions provided by the strataG package (@archer2016). There you can find a detailed description of the function and its arguments. We had to integrate the functionality because strataG is no longer on CRAN.

The possible arguments are listed below:

Some words about admixture

### Admixture Model

-   **Definition**: The admixture model assumes that individuals can have ancestry from multiple populations. This means that the genetic makeup of an individual can be a mixture of two or more populations. This model is particularly useful for analyzing genetic data from populations that are known to have mixed or where there is gene flow between populations.

-   **Application**: It is applied when there is historical or recent admixture between populations, and it allows for the estimation of individual ancestry proportions from each of the inferred clusters. For example, an individual might be 50% from population A, 30% from population B, and 20% from population C under the admixture model.

-   **Utility**: The admixture model can uncover complex patterns of genetic structure that are not apparent under the assumption of discrete, non-overlapping populations.

### No-Admixture Model

-   **Definition**: The no-admixture model assumes that individuals have ancestry from only one population. This model is particularly useful for analyzing genetic data from populations that are known to be isolated from one another.

-   **Application**: This model is used in situations where populations are relatively well-defined and isolated, with little to no gene flow between them. It simplifies the analysis by considering that an individual's entire genetic information originates from one of the K clusters without any mixture.

-   **Utility**: The no-admixture model is useful for identifying distinct populations and their members, especially in cases where populations are clearly separated geographically or temporally.

## Structure Results

Okay now that we got that out of our way lets see how to interprete the results of the structure run.

### Evanno Plots

The Evanno method is a statistical approach used to determine the most likely number of genetic clusters (K) present in a dataset analyzed by STRUCTURE software. STRUCTURE is a computational tool used for inferring population structure using genetic data. Identifying the correct number of clusters (K) is crucial for accurately interpreting genetic data in the context of population structure, evolutionary biology, and conservation genetics. The Evanno method specifically addresses the challenge of choosing the optimal K by analyzing the rate of change in the likelihood of data between successive K values, rather than just relying on the maximum likelihood. This is done through the calculation of ΔK, a quantity based on the second order rate of change of the likelihood function with respect to K. The method suggests that the value of K corresponding to the highest ΔK should be considered the most likely number of clusters present in the dataset.

The Evanno method is a method to determine the most likely number of populations. It is based on the second order rate of change of the likelihood function with respect to K. The method is implemented in the `gl.evanno` function.

```{r}
ev <- gl.evanno(sr)
```

### Plotting the results (Q matrix)

The Q matrix represents the estimated ancestry proportions of individuals across different inferred genetic clusters. STRUCTURE aims to identify K clusters (populations) that best explain the patterns of genetic variation observed in the data, with K either being predefined by the user or determined using methods like the Evanno method.

The Q matrix is essentially a matrix where each row corresponds to an individual in the dataset, and each column represents one of the K inferred genetic clusters. The entries in the matrix are the estimated proportions (ranging from 0 to 1) of each individual's genome that originated from each cluster. The sum of an individual's ancestry proportions across all K clusters equals 1.

The values in the Q matrix can be interpreted as the fraction of an individual's ancestry that comes from each of the K clusters. The Q matrix is often visualized using bar plots or stacked bar graphs, where each individual's ancestry proportions are shown as segments of a bar colored differently for each cluster.

To get a plot for a certain level you need to specify K or at least a range of K.

```{r}

qmat <- gl.plot.structure(sr, K=3:5)
head(qmat[[1]])
```

### A "spatial" structure plot

```{r structure map}
gm <- gl.map.structure(qmat = qmat, x = possums,K=5, scalex=1, scaley=0.5 )
```

-   some simulations?!

## Faststructure

-   how to run it
-   what is the difference (not much in most cases, but faster, though less screws to turn)
