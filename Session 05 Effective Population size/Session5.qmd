# Introduction

Ne is important for conservation and management of populations. It is an indicator of the genetic diversity of a population and is used to estimate the probability of extinction.

Effective population size (*Ne*) is a concept in population genetics that refers to the number of breeding individuals in an idealized population that would show the same amount of genetic drift or inbreeding or linkage disequilbrium or coalescent as the population under study. Unlike the actual census size (*Nc*), which counts all individuals within a population, *Ne* focuses on those contributing genes to the next generation, offering a more precise understanding of a population's genetic health and potential for evolutionary change.

The 50/500 rule is a guideline in conservation biology that relates to the effective population size (*Ne*) and its implications for the conservation of species. This rule was first proposed by Franklin in 1980 and later expanded by Soule in 1986. It serves as a rule of thumb for determining the minimum viable population sizes needed to prevent inbreeding depression in the short term and maintain evolutionary potential over the long term.

Be aware the 50/500 rule is a rule of thumb and should be used with caution. It is not a one-size-fits-all rule and should be used in conjunction with other information about the species and its habitat. It has been criticized for being too simplistic and not taking into account the specific needs of individual species.

#2a Based on SFS

The Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), sometimes referred to as the allele frequency spectrum, is a fundamental concept in population genetics that describes the distribution of allele frequencies at polymorphic sites within a sample of DNA sequences from a population. It provides a powerful summary of the genetic variation present in the population, capturing information about the history of mutations, demographic events (such as population expansions or bottlenecks). There are several methods to estimate historic, but we explore only two here: Epos @lynch2019 and Stairways2 @liu2020

### The SFS

It is straight forward to create the sfs from a genlight/dartR object. But first you want to make sure you do not have missing data in your dataset, because the allele frequency spectrum is sensitive to missing data.

```{r}
# Load the data
gl100 <- readRDS("./data/slim_100.rds")
#check the population size and number of populations
table(pop(gl100))
#number of individuals
nInd(gl100)
#number of loci
nLoc(gl100)

#create 
sfscon <- gl.sfs(gl100, folded = TRUE)
sfscon
```

As you can see the is simply a table of the number of alleles at each frequency. Be aware the the sfs is folded by default, but you can change this with the argument `folded = FALSE`. In most of the cases we will use the folded=TRUE option as you need phased data to use the unfolded sfs (and also have an idea which state is the ancestral one. Often the genomic of an ancestral outgroup is used for this information).

```{r}
#unfolded sfs
un.sfs <- gl.sfs(gl100, folded = FALSE)
un.sfs
```

In addition it is possible to create multidimensional sfs, which is useful for example when you have multiple populations (in case you want to have that use: singlepop=FALSE). Be aware if you want to create and multidimensional sfs from more than say 3 populations a 30 individuals you create a huge array of dimensions (61 x 61 x 61), with mainly zeros. So often multidemensional sfs are not very useful.

So lets have a closer look at the folder sfs from the example. The simulated population had a constant (effective) population size *Ne* of 100 individuals. Hence we know from theory that we have to expect a sfs that follows an exponential distribution.

We now load two more data sets:

```{r}
gldec <- readRDS("./data/slim_100_50_50yago.rds")
glinc <- readRDS("./data/slim_100_200_50yago.rds")
glbottle <- readRDS("./data/slim_100_10_50_50yago_10year.rds")

```

`gldec` is a population that experienced a decline from Ne=100 to Ne=50 50 years ago, while `glinc` is a population that experienced an increase from Ne=100 to Ne=200 50 years ago. And `glbottle` is a data set that experienced a bottleneck from Ne=100 to Ne=10 50 years ago and then an increase to Ne=50 after years.

:::

Below is a plot that shows all four SFS.

```{r, echho=FALSE}
sfsdec <- gl.sfs(gldec, folded = TRUE)
sfsinc <- gl.sfs(glinc, folded = TRUE)
sfsbottle <- gl.sfs(glbottle, folded = TRUE)
```

### examples for different sfs (simulated)

```{r}

df <- data.frame(x=0:50, sfscon, sfsdec, sfsinc, sfsbottle)

g1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=sfscon))+geom_bar(stat="identity")
g2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=sfsdec))+geom_bar(stat="identity")
g3 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=sfsinc))+geom_bar(stat="identity")
g4 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=sfsbottle))+geom_bar(stat="identity")

g1+g2+g3+g4

```

As you can see it is not really possible to see the differences between the sfs, so lets check how good our methods are to recreate the historic population sizes.

### Epos

Lets start with the simple one and lets use Epos (as this is the fastest method). A typical epos run requires the genlight/dartR object, then the path to the epos binary.

There are two more important parameters l and mu. l is the total lenght of the "sampled" chromosome and we will have a discussion on that. mu is the mutation rate per site per generation. The important concept to keep in mind is that

$$ number of mutations = L * mu * (Ne) $$

So to be able to estimate the trajectory in an absolute sense we need to know L and mu. In a simulation that is easy because we know how long the chromosome(s) were we did our simulation on. Here L=5e8 and mu was set to a value of 1e-8.

We could provide the sfs, but the gl.epos function does take care of that in case none is provided (it call gl.sfs). Additional parameters in EPOS are the number of bootstraps that should be run for confidence intervalas (the more the more runs and the longer it takes) and the minimum bins size. Here we use minbinsize=1 (the default), because we have simulated data and also trust our low frequency bins. In a real data set you might want to change that to higer values, though if too high you might delete too much information from your data (the first bins have the highest number of entries and therefore should be the most informative ones).

```{r}
L <- 5e8
mu = 1e-8

#forgive me but you need to name "L" as little l in the function call. 
#will be corrected in the ne
 Ne_epos <- gl.epos(gl100, epos.path = "./binaries/" , l = L, u=mu, boot=10, minbinsize = 1)
colnames(Ne_epos) <- c("generation", "low", "Ne_median", "high")
ggplot(Ne_epos, aes(x=generation, y=Ne_median))+geom_line()+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=low, ymax=high), alpha=0.2)

```

As you might remember the population size was constant at 100 individuals. So we expect the Ne to be 100 for all generations. And indeed the median is 100 for allmost all generations. The confidence intervals are very narrow, which is expected as we have simulated this data set. There is little bit disturbing 'dip' at really low population sizes. This hints to the known limitation that in very recent times there had not been enough mutations to estimate the population size correctly.

Before we go on with the other data sets (fairly easy to run, just replace the gl100 with the other data sets) we should discuss the parameter l and mu. The l parameter is the length of the chromosome that was sampled. In a real data set you might not know that, because this depends on your methods, the amount of filters etc. Hence the question is what happens if you set l wrong. Lets test set and set L to an often used value: number of loci times 69 (because in a dart analysis we get 69 bases of sequence hence that sounds like a reasonable idea).

```{r}
L <- 69 * nLoc(gl100)  #734505
mu = 1e-8

 Ne_epos <- gl.epos(gl100, epos.path = "./binaries/" , l = L, u=mu, boot=10, minbinsize = 1)
colnames(Ne_epos) <- c("generation", "low", "Ne_median", "high")
ggplot(Ne_epos, aes(x=generation, y=Ne_median))+geom_line()+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=low, ymax=high), alpha=0.2)
 
 
```

As you can see this is not a good idea the axis values are completely off. The reason is that the number of mutations is calculated as L \* mu \* Ne. So if you set L too low, you will get a too high Ne (and also the number of generations are off). If you set L too high, you will get a too low Ne. So you need to know the length of the chromosome that you are working with. The good news is that the trajectory is still correct, so we can rely on the shape of the curve, but the absolute values are wrong if L (or mu) are set incorrectly.

::: callout-note
## Exercise

![](images/task.png){.class width="48" height="48"} You can now run epos for different combinations of L and mu. What do you expect if you set L and mu in such a way that L \* mu compensate each other?
:::

::: callout-note
## Exercise

![](images/task.png){.class width="48" height="48"} And now to the next exercise which is the more intersting one: run Epos for all four data sets data sets(glcon, glinc, gldec, glbottle) and compare the results to the simulated trajectories. Once finished you can have a look at the code below.
:::

```{r}
L <- 5e8
mu = 1e-8

#constant
Ne_epos <- gl.epos(gl100, epos.path = "./binaries/" , l = L, u=mu, boot=10, minbinsize = 1)
colnames(Ne_epos) <- c("generation", "low", "Ne_median", "high")
pcon <- ggplot(Ne_epos, aes(x=generation, y=Ne_median))+geom_line()+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=low, ymax=high), alpha=0.2)
 
#constant
Ne_epos <- gl.epos(glinc, epos.path = "./binaries/" , l = L, u=mu, boot=10, minbinsize = 1)
colnames(Ne_epos) <- c("generation", "low", "Ne_median", "high")
pinc <- ggplot(Ne_epos, aes(x=generation, y=Ne_median))+geom_line()+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=low, ymax=high), alpha=0.2)

#constant
Ne_epos <- gl.epos(gldec, epos.path = "./binaries/" , l = L, u=mu, boot=10, minbinsize = 1)
colnames(Ne_epos) <- c("generation", "low", "Ne_median", "high")
pdec <- ggplot(Ne_epos, aes(x=generation, y=Ne_median))+geom_line()+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=low, ymax=high), alpha=0.2)+ylim(c(0, 200))

#constant
Ne_epos <- gl.epos(glbottle, epos.path = "./binaries/" , l = L, u=mu, boot=10, minbinsize = 1)
colnames(Ne_epos) <- c("generation", "low", "Ne_median", "high")
pbottle <- ggplot(Ne_epos, aes(x=generation, y=Ne_median))+geom_line()+geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=low, ymax=high), alpha=0.2)

```

And now we can plot them next all in one go:

```{r}
pcon + pinc + pdec + pbottle
```

Pretty good, or what do you think?

### Stairways2

Stairways is the actually more popular mehtod to estimate the historic population sizes from SNPs. The reason is most likely that EPOS was implemented in a way that makes it really hard to run for a not initiated person (you need to compile c++ and run some commands in GO). The upshot in Epos is that is it much much faster and the results are not too different to stairways. Nevertheless, we will have a go with stairways below.

The good new is that stairways uses the identical input parameters: L, mu, minbinsize. Hence nothing new here an it "suffers" therefore from the same problem if we do not know mu of L the trajectory is okay, but the absolute values on the axis are off.

The main difference (and here I admit I have to resort to a general explanation as it is beyond my paygrade to understand). Epos uses a simple semi-analytical optimization method to find the best fitting trajectory, whereas stairways uses a machine learning approach that takes longer (but potentially explores the parameter space better). My current approach is to use both methods and see if the results are similar.

### needs to be added still

```{r}
  Ne_sw <- gl.stairway2(gl100, stairway.path="./binaries", mu = mu, gentime = 1, run=TRUE, nreps = 30, parallel=2, L=L, minbinsize =1, cleanup = T)





```

# Gone

\[Be aware Gone is very data hungry and seems not to work too well with the number of SNPs we have at our disposal, but in simulations with Ne\~1000 and lots of individuals it seems to work well\].

Gone is a very different method to estimate the population size. It was developed by @santiago2020. The authors utilize LD patterns to infer the demographic history of populations. LD can be affected by various factors including recombination, mutation, genetic drift, and population structure. The method is based on the idea that the LD decay is a function of the population size and the recombination rate. So we need next to our SNP data also a so called linkage map. This can be achieved if you have a reference genome available and you can map the SNPs to the reference genome. Gone itself has not been tested to much for recent population sizes and is still very much under research about its usefullness for recent population sizes.

Below is an implementation to run Gone using the dartRverse, but be aware it has not been much tested. We certainly can run Gone using our simulated data (because we simulted 5 chromosomes and we have a full map of them on those chromosomes).

To see that we can check how many snps we have on the chromosomes in our data sets.

```{r}
table(gl100@chromosome)


```

So lets run Gone (be aware it is not very userfriendly implemented yet in terms of the settings. Gone currently a script file that is hidden within the script_GONE.sh file and you need to edit it there to change it from the defaults.

Explain the settings (important MAF)

```{r}
#takes too long
#Ne_gone <- gl.gone(gl100,gone.path = "./binaries/") #runs parallel via InputParamters
#read it in
Ne_gone <- readRDS("./data/Ne_gone_gl100.rds")

colnames(Ne_gone) <- c("generation", "Ne_mean")

ggplot(Ne_gone, aes(x=generation, y=Ne_mean))+geom_line()


```

Pretty terrible I guess. My first findings indicate the Gone is much more data hungry and works better with much more SNPs, more chromosomes and more individuals. There is a data set I available using 5 chromosomes (but twice in length) and 100 indivduals (being stable all the time)

The plot is below:

```{r}
glgone100 <- readRDS("./data/slimgone_100.rds")

#Ne_gone <- gl.gone(gl100,gone.path = "d:/bernd/r/geohippos/binaries/gone/windows/") #runs parallel via InputParamters
#takes too long

Ne_gone <- readRDS("./data/Ne_gone_100.rds")

colnames(Ne_gone) <- c("generation", "Ne_mean")

ggplot(Ne_gone, aes(x=generation, y=Ne_mean))+geom_line()

```

It is certainly possible that gone is "saveable" but it is obvious that Gone is not very "good" in recent years. There seems to be a sweet spot where Gone works well \>150 Generations and \<300 generations, but that needs more testing.
