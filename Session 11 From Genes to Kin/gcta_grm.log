Accepted options:
--bfile gl_plink
--make-grm-bin
--out gcta_grm

Note: This is a multi-thread program. You could specify the number of threads by the --thread-num option to speed up the computation if there are multiple processors in your machine.

Reading PLINK FAM file from [gl_plink.fam].
103 individuals to be included from [gl_plink.fam].
Reading PLINK BIM file from [gl_plink.bim].
2626 SNPs to be included from [gl_plink.bim].
Reading PLINK BED file from [gl_plink.bed] in SNP-major format ...
Genotype data for 103 individuals and 2626 SNPs to be included from [gl_plink.bed].
Calculating allele frequencies ...
Recoding genotypes (individual major mode) ...

Calculating the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) ... (Note: default speed-optimized mode, may use huge RAM)

Summary of the GRM:
Mean of diagonals = 1.1978
Variance of diagonals = 0.225967
Mean of off-diagonals = -0.0120594
Variance of off-diagonals = 0.0597764
GRM of 103 individuals has been saved in the file [gcta_grm.grm.bin] (in binary format).
Number of SNPs to calculate the genetic relationship between each pair of individuals has been saved in the file [gcta_grm.grm.N.bin] (in binary format).
IDs for the GRM file [gcta_grm.grm.bin] have been saved in the file [gcta_grm.grm.id].
